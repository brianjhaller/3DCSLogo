## Creating Dynamic Visuals with Three.js
#### Introduction to 3D Animation and WebGL API

Three.js is a popular front-end library that uses the WebGL API to create and display animated 3D graphics in a browser leveraging the compute power of the client computerâ€™s Graphics Processing Unit. In this post we are going to find out what Three.js is used for, how it works, and make an interactive animated Codesmith logo!

### This Repo

Contains all the code needed to render the two demos discussed in the blog post.
I added more code to the cube demo to show how loops, groups, and mapping can be used to more effectively "animate" a scene.
Because the code is all contained in a single HTML file, clone this repo to your local machine and use your IDE to open the index.html file on Chrome.
Happy coding!
